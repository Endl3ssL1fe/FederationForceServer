Pretendo Server Emulator for Metroid Prime: Federation Force
This project is a Pretendo-style server emulator for the game Metroid Prime: Federation Force. It is designed to allow local multiplayer gameplay using the Pretendo network protocol, which is used to emulate Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection for GameCube and Nintendo DS games. The server is currently in a test stage and provides basic functionality for packet handling and authentication.
